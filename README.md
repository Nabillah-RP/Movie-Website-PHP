# Movie Website using PHP 

I developed a comprehensive web application in PHP focused on Movie Reviews. This project involved integrating various functionalities, including user registration, login, movie display, and a review system, all supported by a MySQL database. 

The aim was to enhance my skills in web development, database management, and user interaction, resulting in a robust and user-friendly application.
